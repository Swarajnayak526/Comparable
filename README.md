Comaparable is a Interface which is used to comapre the same type object. 
Comaparable is applicable for Comparable type (Means which class implements Comparable interface).
Comparable interface have a method called 'compareTo' which have one arguments .
Comparable implementation should be in same class .
compareTo method is used to compare current instance with the given instance .
1 -> when current instance is greater than the given instance 
-1 -> when current instance is smaller than the given instance .
0 -> when current instance is equal to given instance.
Comparable type Default implementation is natural ordering for String (Using ascii value ) for integer (Ascending to descending)
